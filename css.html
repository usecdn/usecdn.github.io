                    <p>I went to a JavaScript meet-up in Sydney the other night and asked the question "How many people know what CSS Architecture is?". The room was full of different people with varying backgrounds and experience. I thought at minimum around a quarter might know what I was talking about. I was hoping more would. To my surprise, only a handful of people raised their hand.</p>
                    <p>I then asked, "How many people feel the difficulties they have writing CSS at scale have been largely solved by CSS-in-JS?". They weren't stupid, they knew this question was a set-up, nonetheless, many of them obliged me and put their hand up.</p>
                    <p>From the looks in the room, I think many more people felt this way than were willing to admit. At the very least, I think a lot of people believe CSS architecture is no longer relevant in the context of modern JavaScript applications.</p>
                    <p>That perspective was very kindly put to me by Alex Louden on Twitter:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>"Styled Components etc has removed the need for class names completely for me. Now since styles are included in my presentation components (to me at least) it doesn’t feel like a style architecture issue any more?"</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>This is not to criticise that perspective; it's completely valid! Alex is saying tooling helped make some of the challenges he had dealing with CSS (in particular specificity) easier. The challenge now is dealing with components in an application.</p>
                    <p>I understand this perspective, but find it interesting when people see classnames and components as completely different concerns. Classnames and components are just different ways of composing user interfaces. There are still many challenges involved in making good re-useable and scalable front-end systems, no matter how you put them together.</p>
                    <p>These challenges are not new. In fact, there are some well established solutions in CSS architecture that can be easily transferred to component-based style systems. So why are so few people talking about this? And why are many more people completely unaware of the topic?</p>
                    <p>I believe there is a lot that has contributed to this and it's worth reflecting on how we got here...</p>

                    <p>I believe the initial response to CSS-in-JS, from many leaders in the CSS community hasn't helped with understanding and knowledge sharing. I've often heard comments like "People (i.e. younger JavaScript developers) just need to learn CSS better." People who have knowledge about CSS architecture need to do a better job of articulating this experience in a way that is accessible and relevant to new developers. If I'm honest about it, the CSS community has failed at this.</p>
                    <p>But it's not that simple. There are some non-human factors and context we need to consider as well.</p>
                    <p>Before the rise of JavaScript components. The strong and obvious naming conventions of BEM gave developers a system to follow that helped avoid specificity clashes in the "terrifying global scope" of CSS. This alone was reason enough for many people to use BEM. You could get good enough results, without necessarily understanding nuanced reasons behind the conventions.</p>
                    <p>When JavaScript tooling provided a better solution than humans following naming conventions, it opened up UI development to a wider spectrum of developers who previously had less interest in, or reason to focus on, style architecture.</p>
                    <p>Business jumped on the dogpile. They reasoned it would be cheaper to employ developers who could "do everything" and got what they considered to be adequate results by under-investing in UI specialists. Some developers who'd spent half a career perfecting skills in this area felt threatened. Perhaps some were defensive.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, developers working in spaces of growth and opportunity could sometimes be dismissive of skills that were not flavour of the month. There was pride, and hype, and reluctance to admit that new tooling and approaches were not always producing better, more re-useable, front-end architecture.</p>
                    <p>I've been consulting in this space for the last 5 years and I've seen many different systems for building UIs with component-based architecture. The reality is, whilst some aspects of building large scale JavaScript applications are easier, the promise of better, more re-usable UI components hasn't been delivered. Front-end architecture is more varied in approach and the results less re-useable than it was before the rise of JavaScript tooling.</p>
                    <p>Some people might challenge this, but I've seen enough examples to consider it an objective truth. What I have seen is:</p>
                    <div class='mt'>
                        <ul>
                            <li>almost every team has a different approach,</li>
                            <li>90% of components get zero re-use,</li>
                            <li>visual changes are often difficult, slow and expensive,</li>
                            <li>it's harder <strong>than ever</strong> to read and understand styles.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p>Somewhere in the turbulence, we lost the more nuanced reasons behind the naming conventions.</p>
                    <p>The aim of this was to give context, not blame (it's a little bit of everybody's fault). So let's draw a line, and look at how to apply some lessons from CSS architecture to modern JavaScript applications.</p>

                    <h2 class='mb copy' id='css_architecture_for_components'>CSS Architecture for Components</h2>
                    <p>First of all, we need to consider what makes sensible abstractions in UI development. OOCSS, SMACSS and BEM all have a common language when they talk about the different parts of a UI component. I can summarise these as:</p>
                    <div class='mt'>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Layout,</li>
                            <li>Design,</li>
                            <li>UI states, and</li>
                            <li>Application logic</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p>If re-use or long-term maintainability is important, keeping these concerns separate is beneficial. Yet, this is not typically how teams approach the design of a component library.</p>
                    <p>Components can do many things, they might fetch data, they might render HTML, they might call functions to execute business logic and manage application state. Sometimes a single component does all these things. There is usually little distinction around what the responsibility of a component should be. People draw boxes around the visual boundaries of a design and then mix this with application logic. That's how most components are built. We can do better than that.</p>
                    <p>BEM gave semantic meaning to classnames and one of the biggest unseen values in this was we could immediately transfer our intentions to other developers across teams and even projects. If you know BEM you can look at a classname, e.g. <code>button--state-success</code> and immediately recognise this as a modifier for a button class.</p>
                    <p>This kind of semantic meaning is sorely needed for components.</p>
                    <p>With that in mind, let's look at different parts of a UI component, identified in CSS architecture methodologies and redefine them in terms of component architecture.</p>

                    <h2 class='mb copy' id='layout_components'>Layout components</h2>
                    <p>Find a way to distinguish layout components in your application. It might be a comment in the file, a naming convention or the organisation of components in folders... it doesn't matter. What matters is we need a way to convey our intentions quickly to other developers.</p>
                    <p>When we have common understanding of what a layout component is we can enforce expectations in code-reviews or linting.</p>
                    <p>Layout components:</p>
                    <div class='mt'>
                        <ul>
                            <li>own responsibility for layout and nothing more</li>
                            <li>should never apply any presentational styles</li>
                            <li>should not contain any application logic</li>
                            <li>own responsibility for the layout of child items.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p>That last point might be a little confusing at first. Why children and not themselves?</p>
                    <p>In modern CSS there are two parts that contribute to layout:</p>
                    <div class='mt'>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A parent item, which sets the display mode</li>
                            <li>A child item, which participates in the parent items display mode.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p>In other words, we have a <code>grid-container</code> and <code>grid-items</code>, or a <code>flex-container</code> and <code>flex-items</code>. There is always a parent/child relationship.</p>
                    <p>To get the intended layout, we need the parent item and the child item to work together. Updating one of them independently from the other, will result in a broken layout. We have a word for this, it's called a dependency.</p>
                    <p>Despite this dependency, we continue to make these separate components with no direct link. We simply hope that people put them together in the right way and don't change them. We call that an unmanaged dependency.</p>
                    <p>The solution is to co-locate the layout concerns with the parent item. There are a number of ways this can happen...</p>

                <section aria-label='use_a_selector' class='article__section'>
                    <h2 class='mb copy' id='use_a_selector'>Use A * Selector</h2>
                    <p>Use the cascade to your advantage and apply a <code>*</code> selector to target all immediate children of a layout component.</p>
                    <p>For example:</p>
                    <pre><code><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">layout </span><span class="pun">{</span><span class="kwd">
  display</span><span class="pun">:</span><span class="pln"> flex</span><span class="pun">;</span><span class="pln">
</span><span class="pun">}</span><span class="pln">

</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">layout </span><span class="pun">></span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">*</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">{</span><span class="kwd">
  flex</span><span class="kwd">-</span><span class="kwd">basis</span><span class="pun">:</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="lit">50</span><span class="pun">%;</span><span class="pln">
</span><span class="pun">}</span></code></pre>
                    <p>This works, even with CSS-in-JS and you might be interested to know the * selector doesn’t increase specificity, so it’s easy to override with classic CSS, should you need.</p>
                    <p>This might seem simple, but it works in most cases.</p>
